# Getting Started
Ensure you have Java, Gradle, and some Java IDE installed. 
###### Gradle

###### Java

###### Jetbrains IntelliJ

Run the command
```
gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=5.6.2 --distribution-type=bin
```

Then you should just be able to run the project through whatever IDE you are running :)
